DESCRIOTON : This code is designed to create a spam detection system using machine learning. It starts by loading a dataset of emails, which includes messages labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The code cleans the data by replacing missing values and converting the labels into numerical format. It then splits the data into training and testing sets. Using a technique called TF-IDF, the text messages are transformed into numerical features that a machine learning model can understand. A logistic regression model is trained on the training data to learn how to distinguish between spam and ham emails. After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and testing sets. Finally, the code allows the user to input a new email message, which the model analyzes to predict whether it is spam or ham.
