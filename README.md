DESCRIPTION:This task is designed to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham"(non spam) using a ML (Machine Learning model. it begins by loading datasetof emails,
which includes their content and labels (spam or ham).
The text data is then processed using a technique called TF-IDF(Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the email content into numerical features that
the model can understand. The data is  split into a training set, and a Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
The model's performance is evaluated by measuring its accuracy on both the training and test sets. Finally, the model is used to predict whether a new email (provided as input) is spam or ham.
If the model predicts the email as ham, it prints "Ham mail"; otherwise, it prints "Spam mail." The accuracy scores show how well the model is performing, with higher accuracy indicating betterÂ 
classification.
